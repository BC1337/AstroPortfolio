This blog post is for checking the utility of my RSS feed. I have hosted my website on netlify and updated everything on github so everything should be working. I am also subscribed to my RSS feed using NewsFlash and local RSS. This post should be my first update in my RSS reader so hopefully it works. I will probably end up changing these posts up a lot once i get all the functionality working. Thanks for coming out.
